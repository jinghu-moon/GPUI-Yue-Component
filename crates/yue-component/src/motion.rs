//! Yue's motion, read the way the web reads it.
//!
//! Durations come from one 50ms-stepped ladder, `--duration-100` to
//! `--duration-400`. On top of it sit the semantic roles — [`MotionDuration`]
//! and [`MotionEase`] — that a component reaches for first. A component whose
//! layout calls for a different pace may name a ladder rung instead, or derive
//! a special value from one, and says why in its token; it never writes a raw
//! literal (`apps/docs/design/motion.md` in the design system).
//!
//! A value that a gesture releases or that is retargeted mid-flight runs on a
//! spring instead: [`settle_spring`] keeps its velocity across the change,
//! which a duration-based transition cannot.
//!
//! Reduced motion is not a token here: GPUI reads the OS setting and settles
//! every Base transition and spring at once, so the roles keep their values.
